Dear Jeetu,

It has been a long time since we last spoke and I hope all is well with you. I am writing to let you know how much I miss talking to you and catching up.

Recently I have been thinking about the time we have spent together and the memories we have made. I am so glad that our friendship has stood the test of time, and I look forward to many more years of friendship and laughter.

I want to let you know that I am always here for you, no matter what. I hope that you can reach out to me if you ever need a friend to talk to.

All the best,

[Your name]
